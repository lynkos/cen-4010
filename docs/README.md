# Home Maintenance Tracker
> Create maintenance items and set reminders for consumables such as AC filters and even AC drain flushing. That baseboard repainting job your wifey told you to finish 3 months ago and it's still untouched can be set up as a reminder, with the consumables you need to complete it, such as painting tape, what kind of paint, wood putty, etc. Provider webpage can also be integrated for cart creation and also some search logic can be created on the app based on keywords like "Gloss", "Semi-gloss" or "tape", to narrow down the search. A map of the house can be created based on pre-set layouts and filler rooms that can be added to said layouts to create one that fits the user's house. Visually, items that require normal maintenance and consumables purchased, such as the aforementioned AC filters or even weed killer for the yard can be represented within the graphical house layout and color-coded for how close that maintenance or replacement is. More details can be added as found.
